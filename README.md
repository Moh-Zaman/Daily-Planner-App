## Credits

Using the stackedoverflow forums I learnt a lot about dayjs. I still struggle a little bit but am coming to terms with the difficulty of those functions. I found this exercise challenging as I have never encountered anything involving live data like dates. I very much enjoyed this and have used little bits of code from experienced developers to help me make this planner.
